# üêç Learn Python 3 - My Completed Jupyter Notebook Course

This repository contains my completed work through the entire **"Learn Python 3"** course by [jerry-git](https://github.com/jerry-git). I used this as an intensive hands-on training in Python programming using Jupyter Notebooks.

---

## What I Learned

### Beginner level
- Python syntax, variables, and basic types
- Control flow: `if`, `for`, `while`
- Functions and scope
- Data structures: `list`, `dict`, `tuple`, `set`

### Intermediate level
- Functional programming with `map`, `filter`, `lambda`, `zip`
- Object-oriented programming
- Pythonic idioms and code refactoring
- Unit testing, mocking, and working with assertions
- Using the standard library effectively (e.g., `collections`, `datetime`, `pathlib`)
- File handling and text processing

##  Notebooks and Structure

The exercises are organized in folders:
- `notebooks/beginner/` ‚Äì core Python basics
- `notebooks/intermediate/` ‚Äì more advanced tasks and real-world idioms

I also practiced debugging, writing idiomatic Python code, and understanding test-driven development (TDD).

## Course Materials

The original course README and materials are available in [`README.course.md`](./README.course.md).

## Why I Did This

I completed this course as beginning part of my journey toward becoming a GenAI Specialist.  
The goal was to build confidence in Python, prepare for projects using Jupyter, and form good programming habits.
